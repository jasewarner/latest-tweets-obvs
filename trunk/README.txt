Latest Tweets Obvs is a simple plugin that displays, well, latest tweets (obvs) via the Twitter API.

== Description ==

Latest Tweets Obvs uses the Twitter API to securely retrieve the latest tweets from a user account.

The plugin comes with optional CSS, albeit minimal, and is intended to fall back on your base theme styles.
When you are done tweaking the settings, you can display your tweets right away by pasting a shortcode anywhere in your site.

In the plugin settings page, along with choosing how many tweets to show, you can also opt to show or hide the following:

* Replies
* Retweets
* Profile image
* Display name
* Username
* Description (bio)
* Location

As mentioned before, there is also the option to turn off the plugin CSS, if you would rather use your own styles.

When you are done, save your changes and paste `[latest_tweets_obvs]` anywhere in your theme to display the tweets.

1. Upload the `latest-tweets-obvs` package to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Head over to the plugin settings page and add your account, choose your options and add the above mentioned shortcode to your site.

WordPress best sums up what a shortcode is: “A shortcode is a WordPress-specific code that lets you do nifty things with very little effort. Shortcodes can embed files or create objects that would normally require lots of complicated, ugly code in just one line”.
