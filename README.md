## Synopsis

Latest Tweets Obvs uses the Twitter API to securely retrieve the latest tweets from a user account.

The plugin comes with optional CSS, albeit minimal, and is intended to fall back on your base theme styles.

When you are done tweaking the settings, you can display your tweets right away by pasting a shortcode anywhere in your theme/site.

In the plugin settings page, along with choosing how many tweets to show, you can also opt to show or hide the following:

* Replies
* Retweets
* Profile image
* Display name
* Username
* Description (bio)
* Location

As mentioned before, there is also the option to turn off the plugin CSS, if you would rather use your own styles.
